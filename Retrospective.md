## Experience

I found this project to be very straight forward, and I had no trouble getting any of it to work. I was able to complete all of the requirements.

I tested the project manually by adding many todo items and then deleting them in a different order than I added them. I also attempted some simple sql injection techniques to see if I could get anything to break.

I found that the instructions were very clear in what was expected, and that the specific details provided made this project go much faster. The sample code snippets in the README file also provided some good help.

The only time during this project that I had any friction was figuring out how to use code within pug. Instead of converting html to pug, I wanted to write the entire thing in pug start to finish so that I could get a better understanding of how to use it.

After completing the basic requirements of this project, I wanted to push my CSS abilities and attempted to make it look more professional. I used gradients, transitions, and multiple different positioning methods. 

Overall I found this to be a fun project, and had little to no difficulty finishing it.
